summary: An introduction to Bitcoin Ordinals, how they work, and why they’re reshaping the conversation around NFTs and digital ownership.

Bitcoin, the first and most secure blockchain, has traditionally been associated with digital money and a store of value. But with the introduction of **Ordinals**, Bitcoin has entered the world of digital collectibles and NFTs — something previously thought impossible on its base layer.

### What Are Ordinals?

Ordinals are a protocol introduced in 2023 by Casey Rodarmor. They allow individual satoshis (the smallest unit of Bitcoin) to be “inscribed” with arbitrary data, such as text, images, or even small applications. These inscribed satoshis are called **digital artifacts**.

Unlike NFTs on Ethereum or Solana, Ordinals live **directly on Bitcoin’s blockchain**, inheriting its security and decentralization.

### How It Works

- **Satoshis:** Each Bitcoin is made up of 100,000,000 satoshis.
- **Ordinal Theory:** A numbering system assigns a unique identity to every satoshi.
- **Inscriptions:** Extra data (art, code, metadata) can be attached to specific satoshis.

Once inscribed, that satoshi carries the data permanently, secured by the Bitcoin network.

### Why It Matters

- **True On-Chain Storage:** No reliance on external servers or IPFS links.
- **Immutable & Scarce:** Inscriptions are as permanent as Bitcoin itself.
- **Cultural Shift:** Expands Bitcoin from being “digital gold” to also being a canvas for creators.
- **Market Growth:** In just months, Ordinals created a new wave of Bitcoin-native NFTs, collectibles, and marketplaces.

### Example Use Cases

- Digital art collections stored entirely on Bitcoin.
- On-chain metadata for games or digital identity.
- Historical artifacts that live as long as Bitcoin does.

### Key Takeaways

- Ordinals bring NFTs to Bitcoin without altering its base protocol.
- They transform Bitcoin into more than just money — a foundation for digital art and permanence.
- Whether you’re a developer, collector, or just curious, Ordinals represent an exciting new chapter in blockchain innovation.

Bitcoin has always symbolized permanence and trust. With Ordinals, it now also represents **creativity and expression**, cementing its role not only in finance but also in culture.
