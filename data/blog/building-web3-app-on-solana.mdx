summary: A quick walkthrough of how to build a simple Solana web3 application and interact with the blockchain.

Web3 development can feel overwhelming at first, but it doesn’t have to be. Solana is a fast and cost-efficient blockchain that makes it possible to build decentralized apps (dApps) with a smooth user experience. Let’s walk through the basics of creating a simple Solana web3 application.

### Step 1: Setting up the environment

First, install the Solana CLI and configure a devnet wallet:

```bash
    sh -c "$(curl -sSfL https://release.solana.com/stable/install)"
    solana config set --url https://api.devnet.solana.com
    solana-keygen new
```

This gives you a local keypair and a wallet ready for testing.

### Step 2: Connect with JavaScript

You can use the `@solana/web3.js` library to interact with the Solana network. Create a simple script that checks your wallet balance:

```typescript
import { Connection, PublicKey, clusterApiUrl } from '@solana/web3.js'

const connection = new Connection(clusterApiUrl('devnet'))
const wallet = new PublicKey('YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY')

;(async () => {
  const balance = await connection.getBalance(wallet)
  console.log('Balance:', balance / 1e9, 'SOL')
})()
```

### Step 3: Sending a transaction

With just a few lines of code, you can send SOL between accounts. This makes it easy to prototype payments, rewards, or utility functions in your dApp.

### Step 4: Expanding into programs

Solana programs (smart contracts) are written in Rust. You can deploy simple logic like token creation, voting, or gaming mechanics, and then interact with them via `@solana/web3.js`.

That’s it — a very simple entry point into building on Solana. Once you’re comfortable, you can expand your app into NFTs, DeFi protocols, or community tools. The key is to start small, experiment, and grow from there.
