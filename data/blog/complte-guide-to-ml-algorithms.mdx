Machine learning has evolved rapidly over the past several decades. From simple statistical models to modern deep learning frameworks, the field has developed a rich collection of algorithms that power today’s AI applications. Let’s look at the history and main types of machine learning algorithms.

### A Brief History

- **1950s–1960s:** Early AI research focused on symbolic methods and perceptrons (the first neural networks).
- **1970s–1980s:** Statistical methods and decision trees gained popularity as computing power increased.
- **1990s–2000s:** The rise of ensemble methods like Random Forests and boosting, along with support vector machines (SVMs).
- **2010s–Present:** Deep learning revolutionized AI, driven by GPUs and large datasets, enabling breakthroughs in vision, language, and reinforcement learning.

### Categories of Machine Learning Algorithms

1. **Supervised Learning** (train on labeled data, predict outcomes)
2. **Unsupervised Learning** (find hidden patterns without labels)
3. **Reinforcement Learning** (learn by trial and error with rewards)

### 1. Supervised Learning Algorithms

These learn from input-output pairs to make predictions.

- **Linear Regression:** Predicts continuous values (e.g., house prices).
- **Logistic Regression:** Binary classification (e.g., spam vs. not spam).
- **Decision Trees:** Split data into rules for prediction.
- **Random Forests:** Ensemble of decision trees for improved accuracy.
- **Gradient Boosting / XGBoost / LightGBM:** Iteratively improve weak learners to create strong predictors.
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM):** Find the best hyperplane to separate classes.
- **Neural Networks (MLPs):** Layers of interconnected nodes for flexible learning.

### 2. Unsupervised Learning Algorithms

These find structure in unlabeled data.

- **K-Means Clustering:** Partition data into k groups.
- **Hierarchical Clustering:** Build a tree of clusters.
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA):** Reduce dimensionality while preserving variance.
- **t-SNE / UMAP:** Visualization techniques for high-dimensional data.
- **Autoencoders:** Neural networks that compress and reconstruct data.

### 3. Reinforcement Learning Algorithms

These agents learn by interacting with an environment.

- **Q-Learning:** Learn a value function for actions in states.
- **Deep Q-Networks (DQN):** Use neural networks to approximate Q-values.
- **Policy Gradient Methods:** Directly optimize policies (e.g., REINFORCE, PPO).
- **Actor-Critic Methods:** Combine value-based and policy-based approaches.

### 4. Deep Learning Algorithms

Specialized neural network architectures for specific tasks.

- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):** Image recognition and vision tasks.
- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs):** Sequence modeling (e.g., text, speech).
- **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM):** Improved RNNs that handle long dependencies.
- **Transformers:** Modern architecture for language and vision (e.g., GPT, BERT).
- **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs):** Two competing networks to generate realistic data.
