A short and practical introduction to machine learning.

## What is Machine Learning?

Machine Learning (ML) is a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that enables systems to **learn from data** and improve over time without being explicitly programmed.

In simple terms, instead of writing rules for every scenario, we give machines data and let them discover patterns.

## Key Types of ML

1. **Supervised Learning** – The model learns from labeled data.

   - Example: Predicting house prices from past sales.

2. **Unsupervised Learning** – The model finds hidden structures in unlabeled data.

   - Example: Customer segmentation in marketing.

3. **Reinforcement Learning** – The model learns by trial and error with feedback from rewards or penalties.

   - Example: Training robots or game AI.

## Common Algorithms

```python
# Example: Simple Linear Regression in Python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
import numpy as np

X = np.array([[1], [2], [3], [4], [5]])  # feature
y = np.array([2, 4, 6, 8, 10])           # label

model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X, y)

print(model.predict([[6]]))  # ➝ [12.]
```

## Why it Matters

- Powers search engines, recommendations, and chatbots.
- Helps in healthcare, finance, autonomous vehicles, and more.
- Makes businesses more data‑driven.

In short, ML is about teaching machines to **find patterns and make predictions from data**—a foundation for modern AI.
